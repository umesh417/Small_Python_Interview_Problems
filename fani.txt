Extremely Severe Cyclonic Storm Fani (/ˈfɒniː/; Bengali: ফণী, translit. Phaṇī[a]) was the strongest tropical cyclone to strike the Indian state of Odisha since Phailin in 2013. The second named storm and the first severe cyclonic storm of the 2019 North Indian Ocean cyclone season, Fani originated from a tropical depression that formed west of Sumatra in the Indian Ocean on 26 April. Fani slowly drifted westward, finding itself in an area conductive for strengthening. However, as Fani moved northward, the system struggled to intensify, as moderate vertical wind shear hampered the storm's progress. After moving away from the wind shear, Fani began to rapidly intensify, and became an extremely severe cyclonic storm on 30 April 2019, the first severe cyclonic storm of the season. Fani reached its peak intensity on 2 May, as a high-end extremely severe cyclonic storm, and the equivalent of a high-end Category 4 major hurricane. Fani weakened before making landfall, and its convective structure rapidly degraded thereafter. On the next day, Fani passed just north of Kolkata as a cyclonic storm. On 4 May, Fani weakened to a deep depression and moved into Bangladesh, before degenerating into a well-marked low later that day. Fani's remnants dissipated on the next day.

Prior to its landfall, authorities in India and Bangladesh moved at least a million people each from Fani's projected path onto higher ground and into cyclone shelters, which is thought to have reduced the resultant death toll.[4] As of 6 May 2019, 56 people are known to have been killed by Fani in Eastern India and Bangladesh.

Meteorological history
Map plotting the track and the intensity of the storm, according to the Saffir–Simpson scale

The IMD began tracking a depression located west of Sumatra on 26 April, classifying it as BOB 02. Later that day, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on the system.[5] Afterward, the storm slowly coalesced while moving northward and was upgraded to a deep depression at 00:00 UTC on 27 April.[6] At the same time, the JTWC began warning on the system, designating it 01B.[7] Six hours later, the IMD upgraded the system to a cyclonic storm and gave it the name Fani.[8]

The system continued to intensify until 18:00 UTC, after which it stagnated for over a day as convection around the storm's center waxed and waned.[9] Fani resumed strengthening around 12:00 UTC, with the IMD upgrading it to a severe cyclonic storm.[10] At that time, Fani began a period of rapid intensification as it was located within a very favorable environment with sea surface temperatures of 30–31 °C (86–88 °F) and low vertical wind shear. As a result, the JTWC upgraded Fani to a Category 1-equivalent cyclone late on 29 April.[11] Around 00:00 UTC on 30 April, Fani was upgraded to a very severe cyclonic storm by the IMD.[12] The organization of the system continued to improve, with tight spiral banding wrapping into a formative eye feature,[13] resulting in Fani being upgraded to an extremely severe cyclonic storm by the IMD around 12:00 UTC[14] while the JTWC upgraded the storm to a Category 3-equivalent cyclone hours later.[15] Development proceeded more slowly over the following days, with little improvement evident in the system's satellite presentation. On 2 May, however, the central dense overcast became more symmetrical and the eye more distinct, and Fani was upgraded to a Category 4-equivalent cyclone by the JTWC at 06:00 UTC.[16] Shortly after, Fani started another period of rapid intensification, attaining 1-minute sustained winds of 250 km/h (155 mph) just below Category 5-equivalent tropical cyclone intensity, according to the JTWC.[17] At 8:00 a.m. IST (02:30 UTC) 3 May, Fani made landfall near Puri, Odisha with 3-minute sustained winds of 185 km/h (115 mph).[18] Land interaction quickly degraded Fani's convective structure; and it weakened to a Category 1-equivalent tropical cyclone soon after landfall.[19] Fani continued to weaken after landfall, weakening to a cyclonic storm later that day,[20] before passing just north of Kolkata. On 4 May, Fani weakened to a deep depression and moved into Bangladesh,[21] before degenerating into a well-marked low later on the same day.[22] On 5 May, Fani's remnant low dissipated over Bhutan.[citation needed]
Preparations

The India Meteorological Department tracked the storm and issued numerous yellow warnings for much of the south-eastern portion of India when the cyclone started to intensify.[23][24] In preparation for the storm's impact, the state government of Odisha evacuated over 1.2 million residents from vulnerable coastal areas and moved them to higher ground and into cyclone shelters built a few miles inland. The authorities deployed around a thousand emergency workers and 43,000 volunteers in these effort. It sent out 2.6 million text messages to warn of the storm in addition to using television, sirens and public-address systems to communicate the message. About 7,000 kitchens were operated to feed evacuees in 9,000 storm shelters.[25][26]

The Indian Navy readied naval ships and aircraft at Arakkonam and Visakhapatnam air-bases to prepare for the storm's aftermath and aid in reconnaissance, rescue and relief operations.[27] The Odisha government staged "300 power boats, two helicopters and many chain saws, to cut downed trees" for the purpose.[26]

Authorities in Bangladesh were ordered to open shelter areas as well in 19 coastal districts.[28] Bangladesh Navy deployed 32 naval ships to provide emergency relief and medical assistance to the coastal areas in case of any emergencies.[29] More than 1.2 million people were evacuated in Bangladesh and moved to the cyclone shelters in coastal areas.[30]
Impact and aftermath

At least 56 people have been killed by Cyclone Fani; 34 in Odisha,[31] 8 in two districts of Uttar Pradesh,[32] and 14 in eight districts of Bangladesh.[33] In Odisha, a teenager was killed after being hit by a falling tree. One woman died when she was hit by flying debris, and another died of a heart attack while in a cyclone shelter.[34]

The storm adversely affected electricity supply and telecommunication in several coastal areas of Odisha, and to a lesser extent, of West Bengal. Puri and Khordha district in Odisha were the worst hit.[25] The Indian state of Andhra Pradesh reported no loss of life or injury, but estimated an economic damage of ₹58.62 crore (US$8.5 million).[35]

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that the government had released over ₹1000 crore (US$145 million) for the states affected by Fani.[36] The Bangladeshi government distributed rice, dried food, and Tk1.97 crore (US$234,000) to those affected by the cyclone.[37]
